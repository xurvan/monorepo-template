# Clean Architecture Service
We adhere to [Golang standard layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) and primarily follow the
[clean architecture](https://github.com/DoWithLogic/golang-clean-architecture) repository pattern established by
DoWithLogic. However, we've made some minor modifications to ensure compatibility with Protobuf, microservices, and the
monorepo pattern.
